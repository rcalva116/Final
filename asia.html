         <h2>Penanggalan</h2>
          <p>
           The Penanggalan is a Malaysian vampire-type monster, who separates at the neck and flies with her entrails dragging behind her. During the day she appears as a regular woman, but her head flies off at night so she can flit around terrifying people, and supposedly eats newborn babies. Rituals for protection against the monster are by pregnant women or women who recently gave birth. According to the tale, the Penanggalan smells of vinegar, because she must clean her dangling entrails with it. She does this in order to stuff them back into her body through the neck. Legends claim she was once a normal woman, that is until someone startled her so badly that her head popped off. The monster is called by other names, such as Hantu Penanggal, Leyak, or Krasue, in other Southeast Asian countries.

          <h2>Mongolian Death Worm</h2>
          <p>
           The Mongolilan Death Worm is two to five feet long and spits acid at anyone who crosses its path. Locals in Mongolia's Gobi Desert wholeheartedly believe in the creature's existence. The worm is described to be a large red warm with fangs and suction- like face. If you touch it, or if it spits at you, you will die. This can explain why there are no photographs. Regardless, the lack of photo evidence does not diminish the locals' belief in the creature.

          <h2>Namahage</h2>
          <p>
          The Namahage are Japanese ogres who, legend says, once terrorized the countryside if they weren't given bribes of food and, once a year, a young woman. Namahage are frightful demon-like yōkai which live in the mountains along the northern coast of the Sea of Japan. They look like oni, with bright red or blue skin, wild hair and eyes, large mouths full of sharp teeth, and often have horns sprouting from their forehead. They wear straw leggings and raincoats, and carry large blades. The legend originates as ritual that takes place in Japan on New Year's Eve. From then on people dress  in masks as Namahage and  go door-to-door scaring children into hard work and good behavior.

Its body is covered with a thick black fur, and its feet armed with enormous claws. The creature has incredible strength.

         <h2>Vetala</h2>
          <p>
           Some of the world’s oldest tales of vampires come from India, where ancient Hindu stories were taken to other nations by traders and nomads. Among these beings are the Vetala, who are dead but not at rest because the proper funeral rites were not performed for them. They are also described as evil spirits that occupy corpses. A Vetal has uncanny knowledge of the past, present, and future which it uses to confuse  humans. However, there is lore that states that sometimes these vampires  become guards or helpers to sorcerers who enslave them. Vetala live in cemeteries, but wander afield to kill children and livestock. A  Vetal can be recognized because the corpse’s hands and feet are turned backwards.

Another tip is to not to make too much noise while in the woods in order not to offend or disturb the tikbalang.

          <h2>Manticore</h2>
          <p>
           The Manticore is a man-eating chimera with the body of a lion and a human head. The legend of the Manticore arises from the Middle East. The Persians just called it "man-eater". The manticore or mantichore is a Persian legendary creature similar to the Egyptian sphinx that proliferated in western European medieval art as well. It has the head of a human, the body of a lion and a tail of venomous spines similar to porcupine quills, while other depictions have it with the tail of a scorpion. There are some accounts that the spines can be shot like arrows, thus making the manticore a lethal predator. It devours its prey whole, using its triple rows of teeth, leaving no traces of its victims (including bones) behind.
