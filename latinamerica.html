         <h2>El Silbón</h2>
          <p>
           El Silbon is a Venezuelan tale of a vicious whistling spirit. The Whistler is a terrifying man that haunts the Venezuelan and Colombian Llanos region. According to the legend, this man is a ghost who killed his father and later ate his organs. This tall man, who often is reported to wear a raggedy hat, is forever doomed to walk the region as a lost soul. He carries a bag filled with his father's bones. The Whistler gets his name from the bone-chilling whistling sound he emits. The scary part is that when the whistling sounds far away, El Silbón is actually nearby. It is said that hearing his whistle is a bad omen and signifies the death of the person.
