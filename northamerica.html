         <h2>Loogaroo</h2>
          <p>
           Loogaroo are demons that haunt the West Indies, particularly Haiti, Grenada, and the Dominican Republic. The name is derived from the word “loup garou”  which means the French werewolf. The Loogaroo is often described as either a witch or a vampire. Yet, the Loogaroo is also a shapeshifter that holds all the attributes of many other monsters and mythological creatures. In particular, this monster sucks the blood from innocent victims. It is said that the creatures gives it to the devil in exchange for magical powers. The Loogaroo is closely related to the Soucouyant of Trinidad and Guadeloupe. The story warns that if Loogaroo sucks out too much blood, the victim will die and become a Loogaroo as well.

          <h2>Skunk Ape</h2>
          <p>
          The Skunk Ape is a being that made its appearance in the American Deep South, from Oklahoma to North Carolina. The majority of sightings, however, have been reported in Florida. The creature was named the Skunk Ape as a result of its awful odor. In 2000, an anonymous letter reporting a sighting emerged. Attached to the letter were several photographs of what appears to be this ape creature. This reportedly occurred in Myakka City, Florida. The letter’s author suggested that the creature might be an escaped orangutan, but no missing ape was reported. An investigation was later launched after reports of an injured horse were made. The attack was caused by an unknown animal in the same area.

          <h2>Gowrow</h2>
          <p>
          A Gowrow sighting was first reported in Arkansas in 1897. Residents believe it lives in the lakes and caves across Arkansas. It received its name from the horrible sounds it makes. The Gowrow was described as being a 20 to 35 foot reptile with enormous tusks that feeds on livestock. In the early 1900s, a man claimed to have captured a Gowrow. He let the public see it for a small fee. Unsurprisingly, just before the reveal he announced that the Gowrow had escaped, causing mass panic. In Little Rock, a traveling businessman, reported seeing the gowrow during his stay in town. He claimed the creature had been slaughtering livestock and pets near Searcy County. The townspeople reportedly formed a hunting group that tracked the gowrow to a cave. It was littered with animal skeletons and even human remains. The crowd claimed  to have killed the creature. They even alleged to have sent the body  to a museum in D.C, yet no type of remains ever showed up.

          <h2>Jackalope</h2>
          <p>
           The Jackalope is supposedly a cross between a rabbit and an antelope. Some even say it is a mix between a goat or deer. It have been seen over most parts of the United States. Interestingly, Jackalopes are said to only mate during electrical storms. They can be caught by using whiskey as bait, which will render them easier to sneak up on. Additionally, Jackalope milk is supposed to have medicinal qualities. The legend of the Jackalope may have come from sightings of rabbits infected with the Shope papillomavirus, which causes hornlike growths. The Jackalope is rumored to be extinct.

          <h2>The Loveland Frog</h2>
          <p>
           The town of Loveland, Ohio has had multiple strange sightings of an unusual reptile. This creature has become known as the Loveland Frog. The most popular sighting was by police officer Ray Shockey in 1972. He reported seeing an animal lying beside the road, and when he approached, it got up on two legs and ran away. The officer described it as being three to four feet tall, around 60lbs, with a face of that of a lizard or frog. Another officer, Mark Matthews,  had a similar encounter a couple of weeks later. In 1955, a businessman claimed he saw three hairless creatures beside the road. They were three to four feet tall, had wrinkles on their heads, and webbed hands and feet. Then one of the beings waved its hand and emitted sparks from it.

          <h2>The Beast of Bladenboro</h2>
          <p>
          The Beast of Bladenboro is a huge catlike monster. In 1953, Bladenboro, North Carolina was the scene of unexplained attacks. One farmer saw a beast resembling a cat carry his dog off. Days later, several dog carcasses were later found drained of blood. Hunters came from all over the country to hunt the vampire creature. Tired of the attention, the town’s residents killed a bobcat and put it up for display in order to silence the lore. Regardless some reports have surfaced that the beast remains active.
